## Ch-1 
They first must bundle all our code together before serving it to the browser. Instead, Vite natively supports the ECMAScript module (ESM) standard. Furthermore, Vite requires very little configuration to get started. A downside of Vite is that it can be hard to configure certain more complex scenarios with it. An upcoming bundler that is promising is Turbopack; however, it is still very new at the time of writing. For full-stack development with server-side rendering, we will later get to know Next.js, which is a React framework that also provides a 
dev server out of the box.

# objectives
   Writing and running scripts with Node.js 
   Introducing Docker, a platform for containers

   Accessing the MongoDB database via Node.js

// Docker is a platform that allow us to package, manage, and run applications in loosely isolated environment called containers, Containers are lightweight, are isolated from each other and include all dependencies needed to run an application.  

You build React → Docker builds image → Docker runs container → App runs
